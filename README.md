  <h3 align="center">FRACTALRABBIT</h3>
<p>
In modelling a sequence of adaptive choices by an intelligent agent (e.g. places visited, web sites browsed), memory-less random walks are unsuitable, because of the formation of agent habits and preferences. 
 </p>

<p>
 Often these choices are only partially observed, and report times are sporadic and bursty, in contrast to regular or exponentially spaced times in classical models. 
</p>

<p>
The FRACTALRABBIT stochastic mobility simulator creates realistic synthetic sporadic waypoint data sets. It consist of three tiers, each based on new stochastic models: </p>

  <p align="center">	
	 (1) An Agoraphobic Point Process generates a set V of space points, whose limit is a random fractal, representing sites that could be visited. </p>

  <p align="center">	(2) A Retro-preferential Process generates a trajectory X through V , with strategic homing and self-reinforcing site Ô¨Ådelity as observed in human/animal behavior. </p>

  <p align="center">	 (3) A Sporadic Reporting Process models time points T at which the trajectory X is observed, with bursts of reports and heavy tailed inter-event times.</p>
  </p>
</p>
<p>
 FRACTALRABBIT can be used to test algorithms applicable to sporadic waypoint data, such as (1) co-travel mining, (2) anomaly detection, and (3) extraction of maximal self-consistent subsets of corrupted data.

## Status
Java version runs from the command line:
<p>
	java -jar fractalrabbit.jar parameters.csv outputfilename.csv</p>
<p>	
An example of the parameters.csv file is provided in the resources folder.
Change it to suit your modelling needs. 
It permits multiple travellers to follow the same trajectory asynchronously.
