### FRACTALRABBIT

The FRACTALRABBIT stochastic mobility simulator creates realistic synthetic sporadic waypoint data sets. It consist of three tiers, each based on new stochastic models:

(1) An Agoraphobic Point Process generates a set V of space points, whose limit is a random fractal, representing sites that could be visited.

(2) A Retro-preferential Process generates a trajectory X through V , with strategic homing and self-reinforcing site Ô¨Ådelity as observed in human/animal behavior.

(3) A Sporadic Reporting Process models time points T at which the trajectory X is observed, with bursts of reports and heavy tailed inter-event times.

## Status
Java version runs from the command line:

```
java -jar fractalrabbit.jar parameters.csv
```

An example of the parameters.csv file is given below. Change it to suit your modelling needs. It permits multiple travellers to follow the same trajectory asynchronously.

Two historical versions are available:

* [Mathematica Notebook, for independent trajectories](RetroPreferentialSporadicSimulator.nb), visible in [Text version](RetroPreferentialSporadicSimulatorCopy.pdf)

* [Python Version, for independent trajectories](RetroPreferentialSporadicSimulator.py)
